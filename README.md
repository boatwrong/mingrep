### miniature grep
* recreate grep knowing how it functions
	* attempt to not cheat and look at source code
* how small can I get grep to be and make it more personally effective
for my own use

### TODO
* look at more functions of grep
	- need to make more robust flag input for this to be possible
* make utility files for functions to clean up main

#### NOTES
