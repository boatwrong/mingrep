### miniature grep
* recreate grep knowing how it functions
	* attempt to not cheat and look at source code
* how small can I get grep to be and make it more personally effective
for my own use

### TODO
* Look into the -A flag 
	- prints 'n' lines after the line where expression was found
* make utility files for functions to clean up main
* expand on getopt usage
	- starting work on idea of using bools for "flags" to structure flow of search
